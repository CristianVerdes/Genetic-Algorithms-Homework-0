# Genetic-Algorithms-Homework-0
The idea to this project is to try to maximize (finding 0) 4 functions (rast_function, griew_function, rosen_function, six_function)
using a simple random function. We set an interval (a,b) and a number of parameters. Then we fill a list with random numbers in (a,b)
and then execute one function with the list as a parameter.
The point of this homework was to show us how fast a Genetic Algorithm is and how close he can get to our solution. (See next G.A. Homeworks)
